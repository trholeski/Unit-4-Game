Title: Unit-4-Game-

This is a game in which the users intent is to remember the number value of the jewels after they click on them once and match the user's total to the randomly generated target total.  The target total and the jewel values change randomly each time the game restarts.  The game restart each time the user breaches the target total or matches the target total.  In either case the "wins" or "losses" field will increment by 1, relative to the results of the game.

Have fun!
